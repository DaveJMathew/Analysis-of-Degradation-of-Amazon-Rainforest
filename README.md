# Analysis-of-Degradation-of-Amazon-Rainforest
Using Data visualisation to analysis the state of degradation of the amazon rainforest

Project was done as part of UQ's COSC3000 course(Data visualisation and Computer Graphics)

Raw data was collected from an online repository[1] which were stored in csv files (amazon fires, areas, el nino la nina)

The data was analysed in python (project.py) using python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, seaborn etc

The visualisations produced are stored in the visualisations folder.

A detailed report of the project has been added as well(COSC300 Visulaisation Report.pdf)
